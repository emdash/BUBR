# Bottom-up Beta Reduction

This crate startes as an attempt to implement DAG-based beta-reduction
algorithm described in [Shivers & Wand
2010](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/wand/papers/shivers-wand-10.pdf)

So far I am lost just trying to express basic lambda calculus in safe
rust.

Currently working through Ch3 of
[FPPGR](https://clean.cs.ru.nl/Functional_Programming_and_Parallel_Graph_Rewriting).


## Overview

This crate explores the intersection of lambda calculus and generic
programming in rust.

The goal is simply to understand the foundations of computing as well
as advanced use of rust's type system.
